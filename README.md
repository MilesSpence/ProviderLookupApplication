# ProviderLookupApplication
I created this web-based application that lets a user search for any medical provider in the country using the providerâ€™s first name, last name, specialization, city, state, and/or zip code. After entering any search criteria a list of all matching providers is displayed. The user may then click on any provider's name to get more information on the provider such as practice/business name, business contact info, a full description of the provider, and more. The project uses a real database with all of the providers in the country. The database can be found at: https://download.cms.gov/nppes/NPI_Files.html. The project was implemented with a Postgres database, Django framework, and Bootstrap for help with the appearance. In addition, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Git, and a virtual environment were used in the creation of the project.
